This project was created for the [ACDH-CH OPEN DATA VIRTUAL HACKATHON 2020](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/about-acdh-ch/news-archive/news-detail/article/acdh-ch-open-data-virtual-hackathon-round-two) by [Francesca Giovannetti](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesc.giovannett6), [Ivan Heibi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/ivan.heibi2) and [Bruno Sartini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/bruno.sartini3).

The aim of this project is to investigate the techniques taught by the different DH courses and the collaborations in terms of academic publications between institutions within the field of Digital Humanities. The data from the Digital Humanities Course Registry were integrated with scholarly external datasets such as Microsoft Academics and Crossref.

The final visualization is accessible [here](https://br0ast.github.io/ACDH-2020/).
